### Module 3 Quiz Question 4
In an effort to improve efficiency, hospital administrators are evaluating a new triage system for their emergency room. 
In an validation study of the system, 5 patients were tracked in a mock ER under both the new and old triage system. 
Their waiting times were recorded. Would it be better to use an independent group or paired T confidence interval in 
this setting?

- Independent group interval			
- A paired interval	(Correct)

### Module 3 Quiz Question 5
Refer to the setting of the previous question. To further test the system, administrators selected 20 nights and randomly assigned the new triage system to be used on 10 nights and the standard system on the remaining 10 nights. They calculated the nightly median waiting time (MWT) to see a physician. The average MWT for the new system was 3 hours with a variance of 0.60 while the average MWT for the old system was 5 hours with a variance of 0.68. Give a 95% confidence interval estimate for the differences of the mean MWT associated with the new system. Assume a constant variance.

- A mean decrease of between 2.60 and 1.40 hours.			
- A mean decrease of between 3.68 and 0.32 hours.	(Incorrect)	
- A mean decrease of between 2.75 and 1.25 hours.

### Module 3 Quiz Question 6
Suppose that you create a 95% T confidence interval. You then create a 90% interval using the same data. What can be said about the 90% interval with respect to the 95% interval?

- The interval will be narrower.			
- The interval will be wider.			
- The interval will be centered at a different number.			
- The interval will be the same width.	(Incorrect)
