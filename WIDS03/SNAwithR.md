Social Network Analysis with R
===============================

Social network analysis (SNA) is the analysis of social networks. Social network analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory, consisting of nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships between the individuals, such as friendship, kinship, organizations, sexual relationships, etc.)

These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines.
