### Agreement: Statistical Tools for Measuring Agreement

- This package computes several statistics for measuring agreement, for example, mean square deviation (MSD), total deviation index (TDI) or concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). 
- It can be used for both continuous data and categorical data for multiple raters and multiple readings cases.

Agreement Measurements Summary 

Under the normal or log-normal distribution, each of the agreement measurements (MSD, CCC, TDI, and CP) 
basically measures the same information but from different perspectives. Note that the asymptotic variances 
of MSD, CCC, preci- sion, and accuracy were derived from the covariance matrix of
the sample moments, in which the normality assumption was used, even though the point estimates do not 
depend on the normality assumption. None of the methods proposed in this article is expected to be 
robust against outliers and/or large deviation from normality. The interpretation of MSD is 
difficult to understand. The TDI is desirable as an alternative because of its straightforward
interpretation.
