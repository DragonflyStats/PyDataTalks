\subsection{Criticism of Bland Altman Plots}

An Evaluation of the correlation between the difference and means
complement the analysis.
\\
Bland and Altman caution that the calculations are based on the
assumption that the data is normally distributed. This can be
verified by using a histogram. If Data is not normally
distributed, it can be transformed.
\\
Luiz \emph{et al} remarks that that Bland Altman Plot should be
used only for small data sets, as the use of an index will be of
little value to the analysis.

Hopkins[$8$] argues that the plot indicates incorrectly that there
are systematic differences or bias in the relationship between two
measures, when one has been calibrated against the other.

Unfortunately the Bland-Altman plot has a fatal flaw: it indicates
incorrectly that there are systematic differences or bias in the
relationship between two measures, when one has been calibrated
