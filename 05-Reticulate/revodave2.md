The reticulate package was first released on Github in January 2017, and has been available on CRAN since March 2017. It has already spawned several higher-level integrations between R and Python-based systems, including:

H204GPU, a R package for H20's GPU-based scikit-learn-like suite of algorithms;
greta, a packagefor Bayesian model estimation with Markov-chain Monte-carlo, based on Tensorflow
spacyr, a wrapper for the spaCy natural language processing toolkit; and
XRPython, John Chamber's interface to Python based on his XR package for language extensions to R, which now uses reticulate for its low-level interface to Python.
The reticulate package is available now on CRAN. You can find more details in the announcement at the link below.
