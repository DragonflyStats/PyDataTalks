		\noindent \textbf{Kaplan-Meier Model}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This model gives us a maximum-likelihood estimate of the survival function $\hat{S}(t)$ like that shown in the first diagram above.
			
			% S^(t)= \prod ti<t \frac{niâˆ’di}{ni}
			
			where dd and nn are respectively the count of 'death' events and individuals at risk at timestep ii.
			
			\item The cumulative product gives us a non-increasing curve where we can read off, at any timestep during the study, the estimated probability of survival from the start to that timestep. 
			\item We can also compute the estimated survival time or \textbf{\textit{median survival time (half-life)}} as shown above.
		\end{itemize}
